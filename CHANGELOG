# Update Routines not working on original code, errors being generated when the update link is called:

Current error:  

(1/1) ErrorException
count(): Parameter must be an array or an object that implements Countable
at count(object(Employee))in EmployeeManagementController.php (line 105)

Investigating, and hope to fix.  All of the update code is broke, so I suspect the routine is flawed, and a cut&paste has been applied.

Changes made to the error check to remove the count = 0 check on top of the check for NULL.
As a result the update routine is now working.

Changing the views, to change "update" to "edit" which makes more sense for the action taking place, the update action takes 
place when the update page is submitted. Also correcting a number of typing errors.
