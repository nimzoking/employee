# Update Routines not working on original code, errors being generated when the update link is called:

Current error:  

(1/1) ErrorException
count(): Parameter must be an array or an object that implements Countable
at count(object(Employee))in EmployeeManagementController.php (line 105)

Investigating, and hope to fix.  All of the update code is broke, so I suspect the routine is flawed, and a cut&paste has been applied.
